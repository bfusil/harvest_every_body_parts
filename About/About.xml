<b>A simple mod for harvesting almost any human body parts for replacement or trade use.</b>

Here is a table with some useful information:
<b>Organs	Origin	Value	Mass	Install Skill	Death on Fail</b>
Heart	Vanilla	1200	1	8	0.25
Lung	Vanilla	1000	1	5	0
Kidney	Vanilla	900	1	0	5
Liver	Vanilla	1200	2	5	0
Eye	Mod	1200	0.2	5	0
Ear	Mod	1000	0.2	5	0
Nose	Mod	700	0.2	5	0
Jaw	Mod	1000	1	5	0
Tongue	Mod	700	0.2	5	0
Spine	Mod	1200	1	8	0.25
Stomach	Mod	1000	2	5	0
Arm	Mod	1200	4	5	0
Hand	Mod	900	1	5	0
Leg	Mod	1200	7	5	0
Foot	Mod	900	1	5	0

<b>How to use this mod?</b>

The list of new organs and limbs to harvest are listed in the table above. They are marked as "Mod" in the "Origin" column.
Proceed as usual to harvest or install.

As in the original game, it's not possible to harvest a sick organ. When the text mention "Amputate", the resulting operation will not grant a new organ but only remove the damaged one.

Removing any organ or limb from anyone will potentially make the colonists gain tremendous, stackable, mood penalties.
Pawns with the "Bloodlust", "Cannibal" or "Psychopath" traits are not affected by the organ harvesting of other people. With the Ideology DLC, those with the "Organ Use: Acceptable" Ideoligion are not affected by the harvesting of other people. Other Ideologion precepts may change moodlets for harvest and organ or limb use.
