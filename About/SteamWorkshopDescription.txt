[h2]How to use this mod?[/h2]]

The list of new organs and limbs to harvest are listed in the table above. They are marked as "Mod" in the "Origin" column.
Proceed as usual to harvest or install.

As in the original game, it's not possible to harvest a sick organ. When the text mention "Amputate", the resulting operation will not grant a new organ but only remove the damaged one.

Removing any organ or limb from anyone will potentially make the colonists gain tremendous, stackable, mood penalties.
Pawns with the "Bloodlust", "Cannibal" or "Psychopath" traits are not affected by the organ harvesting of other people. With the Ideology DLC, those with the "Organ Use: Acceptable" Ideoligion are not affected by the harvesting of other people. Other Ideologion precepts may change moodlets for harvest and organ or limb use.

[h2]Alternatives to Harvest Every Body Parts[/h2]

With the Ideology DLC, it's possible to research "Biosculpting" and "Bioregeneration", then using the biosculpter pod's bioregeneration cycle to restore all of the following body parts: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, fingers, and toes. It will also heal a scar, old wound or one of the following ailment: artery blockages, asthma, bad back, blindness, cataracts, frail, and hearing loss.
Biosculpter pod's bioregeneration cycle costs 5 nutrition and 2 glitterworld medicine. The pawn will be suspended in the pod and unavailable for 8 to 25 days.

[h2]Known issues[/h2]

When a limb is scared or wounded, it's possible to replace it with a wooden or peg equivalent and get the original limb as a result. This limb can then be reinstalled without any scar or wound.

It's not possible to install a natural arm on a pawn with a removed prosthetic or bionic arm because a natural arm doesn't include shoulder, unlike the prosthetic and bionic counterpart.

[h2]About the mod development[/h2]

Between prosthetic and bionics there is a large gap in research, cost, and limbs efficiency since prosthetic gives you 50% to 85% and bionics 100% to 125%. With this mod and my other mod: "Scar Removal Drug" (see below), most conditions can now be healed if needed, even in an early game.

In a previous RimWorld patch, the value of organs was greatly increased. Therefore, the same was made for the body parts value of this mod. Also, all install medical operations with natural body parts requires a medical skill of 5 minimum.
Harvesting and installing a brain would mean new backstories, traits and skills with no added value compared to recruiting another pawn. Therefore, it's not included.

Safe to install or remove with ongoing save.
Should be compatible with most mods but have a great chance to be incompatible with mods like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1949064302]EPOE-Forked[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850429707]RBSE[/url] or similar.
